**THIS PROJECT IS PART OF UDACITY'S NANO DEGREE AI PROGRAMMING WITH PYTHON PROGRAM IN COLLABORATION WITH AWS AI/ML SCHOLARSHIP'24**

This project utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify dog breeds from images.
It compares three different CNN architectures: ResNet, VGG, and AlexNet, to determine which model performs the best in identifying dog breeds and distinguishing between dog and non-dog images.

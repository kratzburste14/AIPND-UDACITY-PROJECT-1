Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, all three model architectures cannot classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg , which in my case , is labrador_retriever_01.jpg.
        VGG only correctly classified the dog breed whereas AlexNet and ResNet could not. AlexNet classified the labrador_retriever_01 as kuvasz,
        and ResNet did classify the horizontally flipped image of labrador_retriever_01 correctly but could not classify the original image of labrador_retriever_01.


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: AlexNet classified the breed of dog in labrador_retriever_01.jpg as kuvasz and classified same for labrador_retriever_02.jpg.
        Even if, the breed is wrong but AlexNet identified both the pictures similar to each other.
        ResNet correctly classified the breed of dog in labrador_retriever_02.jpg as labrador retriever but misclassified the breed as sealyham for original image.
        This proved that ResNet could not identify both the pictures to be similar. 
        VGG correctly classified both the pictures of labrador_retriever_01 and labrador_retriever_02 as labrador retriever.
        VGG could correctly classify the breeds, as well as, could identify that the pictures are similar to each other. 


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: VGG correctly classified both the Animal_Name_01.jpg as whale_01.jpg in my case and Object_Name_01.jpg as chair_01.jpg in my case, to not be dogs. 
        AlexNet misclassified the whale_01.jpg as shark but did not classify it as dog. It correctly classified chair_01.jpg as chair and did not classify it as dog.
        Hence, AlexNet could identify accurately both the animal and object to not be dogs.
        ResNet performed similar to AlexNet. It misclassified the whale as dugong but did not classify it as dog breed and classified chair correctly and did not classify it as dog.
        Hence , this proves all the three model architectures classified the animal and object to not be dogs correctly.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: Based on the provided results:
        VGG achieved the highest overall performance with 100% accuracy in all categories (dog identification, breed classification, and not-dog classification).
        ResNet had a mixed performance with 50% correct breed classification, but with some misclassifications.
        AlexNet struggled with breed classification, achieving 0% accuracy in that category.
        Therefore, VGG is selected as the best model architecture for classifying the four uploaded images due to its consistent and perfect performance across all metrics provided.
